  <p>Artic is an organization, started in 2019, which deals in creating digital products for real-world implementation. This includes services using the web applications, mobile applications, and other subsidiaries for such applications.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Why Artic?</h3>
  <p>In real-time scenario, it has been alleged that approximately 90% of humans tend to use and create new innovations from existing innovation. People generally find it convenient to make changes to an existing system for ease-of-living. Among this lies several citizens, who wish to create a subsidiary of any application, to offer users an advanced as well as varied basis of choice for the service to choose. For example, in the 1970's and 1980's, Walmart was a leading producer for services for human daily needs. When the urge to create choices for different users arised, Walmart supposedly received a competition with Amazon for digital marketing. Amazon was later followed by different competitors in specific countires, like Flipkart, Snapdeal in India, Yandex in Russia, Shopify in Canada, and many other places that displayed interest in customer handling via their application and providing services to the customers. When such applications began to develop, people began to find themselves convenient to find a large variety of options to choose from, as well as trusted remarks for better understanding of quality of service. And the people who blink to create such an oppurtunity for customers are keen to find developers for their project, and hire them as individuals to keep the data secured(non-disclosed).<br>

          The graphical data displays that humans from all age groups are more attracted towards writing the blogs, and sharing their opinions, views, or sharing information with the world.

          Among this population, lies several bloggers, who are not able to capture much of the public attention, even if they appear to be great writers. This happens, bacuse categorically, only the top rated blogs are viewed by the users eye. And top-rated blogs are written generally by top-rated bloggers. So the population for such bloggers restricts to limit the community for biased views for any category or topic. And if someone wishes to be rated among the top, and is a great writer too, most cases do show that such people are really afraid of exposing themselves to the world, by the means of many social media platforms, and tend to lose out the scope of writing. This way, we lose approximately a hundred great writers each. <br>

        <div class="description_rp">
          Artic - Blog is a non-biased, public exposure, social media platform, on which, people can express their feelings and there opinions on different views and presence reports for occasions, for interaction, as well as for sharing their thoughts by this medium. Artic-Blog clearly displays the most recent published articles, or any other form of write-up for topics that were been displayed as a text for that topic. This application also provides its users a method to create articles, and share their own experience with the world. For writing articles, the users only need to login with the name they wish to be displayed to the world as their identitiy, and a few basic personal details like age, gender, and such information. After such registration, the user os free to write as many articles as he or she desires to and make the most of the application.<br>

        <div class="title_rp">Literature Review</div>
        <div class="description_rp">
          The concept of this application has been extracted from two different existing domains. One being Blogspot.com and Wordpress.com, which are the current leaders for creating blogs and articles for publishing and making it available for view to the world. These applications displayed the necessary information that needs to be taken from any user for feeding into the application for perusal to other users. Also, they explained the data flow of how the data needs to be taken and how it needs to be made available to the people around the globe.<br>
          The other application which is responsible for the creation of this application is Duck-Duck Go browser. This application too holds an important role, as this browser inspired us to make unbiased choice for visibility of users to all write-ups, rather than several write-ups. Restrictedd access to most popular posts generally deny a varied access to any viewer as well as to the authors for such writers. Un-Biased views to choice is what is mostly appreciated by humans these days, as well as guarantees the author more views for their posts.
