  <p>Artic is an organization, started in 2019, which deals in creating digital products for real-world implementation. This includes services using the web applications, mobile applications, and other subsidiaries for such applications.</p>

  <h3>Why Artic?</h3>
  <p>In real-time scenario, it has been alleged that approximately 90% of humans tend to use and create new innovations from existing innovation. People generally find it convenient to make changes to an existing system for ease-of-living. Among this lies several citizens, who wish to create a subsidiary of any application, to offer users an advanced as well as varied basis of choice for the service to choose. For example, in the 1970's and 1980's, Walmart was a leading producer for services for human daily needs. When the urge to create choices for different users arised, Walmart supposedly received a competition with Amazon for digital marketing. Amazon was later followed by different competitors in specific countires, like Flipkart, Snapdeal in India, Yandex in Russia, Shopify in Canada, and many other places that displayed interest in customer handling via their application and providing services to the customers. When such applications began to develop, people began to find themselves convenient to find a large variety of options to choose from, as well as trusted remarks for better understanding of quality of service. And the people who blink to create such an oppurtunity for customers are keen to find developers for their project, and hire them as individuals to keep the data secured(non-disclosed).<br>We, at Artic, tend to provide such crafted skillsmen to find suitable developers who can hire short-time workers for constructing their applications, as well as maintaining flow of application practise for future scopes of the application.</p>
