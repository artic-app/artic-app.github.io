  <p>Artic is a Git organization, started in 2019, which deals in creating digital products for real-world implementation. This includes services for web app, mobile apps, as well as several other implementation methodologies in the field of technologies.</p>
  <!-- <br> -->
  <h3>Why Artic?</h3>
  <p>In real-time scenario, it has been alleged that approximately 90% of humans tend to use and create new innovations from existing innovation. People generally find it convenient to make changes to an existing system for ease-of-living. Among this lies several citizens, who wish to create a subsidiary of any application, to offer users an advanced as well as varied basis of choice for the service to choose. For example, in the 1970's and 1980's, Walmart was a leading producer for services for human daily needs. When the urge to create choices for different users arised, Walmart supposedly received a competition with Amazon for digital marketing. Amazon was later followed by different competitors in specific countires, like Flipkart, Snapdeal in India, Yandex in Russia, Shopify in Canada, and many other places that displayed interest in customer handling via their application and providing services to the customers. When such applications began to develop, people began to find themselves convenient to find a large variety of options to choose from, as well as trusted remarks for better understanding of quality of service. And the people who blink to create such an oppurtunity for customers are keen to find developers for their project, and hire them as individuals to keep the data secured(non-disclosed).<br>

          The graphical data displays that humans from all age groups are more attracted towards writing the blogs, and sharing their opinions, views, or sharing information with the world.
        </div>
          <br>
          Among this population, lies several bloggers, who are not able to capture much of the public attention, even if they appear to be great writers. This happens, bacuse categorically, only the top rated blogs are viewed by the users eye. And top-rated blogs are written generally by top-rated bloggers. So the population for such bloggers restricts to limit the community for biased views for any category or topic. And if someone wishes to be rated among the top, and is a great writer too, most cases do show that such people are really afraid of exposing themselves to the world, by the means of many social media platforms, and tend to lose out the scope of writing. This way, we lose approximately a hundred great writers each. <br>

        <div class="description_rp">
          The concept of this application has been extracted from two different existing domains. One being Blogspot.com and Wordpress.com, which are the current leaders for creating blogs and articles for publishing and making it available for view to the world. These applications displayed the necessary information that needs to be taken from any user for feeding into the application for perusal to other users. Also, they explained the data flow of how the data needs to be taken and how it needs to be made available to the people around the globe.<br>
          The other application which is responsible for the creation of this application is Duck-Duck Go browser. This application too holds an important role, as this browser inspired us to make unbiased choice for visibility of users to all write-ups, rather than several write-ups. Restrictedd access to most popular posts generally deny a varied access to any viewer as well as to the authors for such writers. Un-Biased views to choice is what is mostly appreciated by humans these days, as well as guarantees the author more views for their posts.

          In the current digital world, Numeracy is the ability of using mathematics and numbers. Humans do wander for solutions to fetch solutions to different mathematical problems, at ease of resources and skills to measure. It is not always possible to calculate using hard steps or brain calculation to solve aritmetic problems. As involving resources to find simple artihmetic solutions seems to be a heavy task, as time and energy are both wasted for the purpose, thus a calculator comes in picture with the solution to provide its users with solution to the different levels of probelms with solve-at-ease. As it happens so for best user-experience it is thoughtful to provide the user with lockscreen and homescreen widgets that can be used for regular calculation. User experiences makes the user more attracted to any application.
